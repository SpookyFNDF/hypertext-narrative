	<h1>The Dwarves' Goal</h1>
	<p>It turns out the dwarves are on a grand quest to recover their home in the Lonely Mountain, <br> 
for the hoarding dragon Smaug has taken control of their home and their giant pile of treasure within the mountain.<br>
Gandalf has been assisting the dwarves and the mysterious symbols on Bilbo's door were a sign for the dwarves that Bilbo's home should be their meeting place.</p>
